# Fortuna

Fortuna is an Expenses Tracker mobile app built with React Native and Expo, thought to help you manage the flows of your own money without exposing your data publicly on the cloud by online services. The app is offline-first by design so you won't need to be connected to the internet to see how your financial health looks like. By leveraging the power of LLMs, the app processes will help you speed up the classification of your transactions so you can focus on getting information out of the data you upload.
